This is the introduction
<!--more-->
And this is the rest of the content

Notes for post:
* [Main page](https://jsonnet.org)
* [Helpful reference](https://dev.to/kubeden/jsonnet-adventures-deploying-our-application-to-argocd-4fk2)
* [ArgoCD diff](https://codefresh.io/blog/argo-cd-preview-diff/)
* Gotcha that the `argocd` CLI tool doesn't work unless you are in the right Kubernetes namespace - otherwise you get `FATA[0000] error retrieving argocd-cm: configmap "argocd-cm" not found`
