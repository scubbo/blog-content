Just a quick note to record that, for the first time, I'm taking part [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) - a series of programming challenges that run every day from the 1st to the 25th of December. Inspired by my [experiences]({{< ref "/posts/short-thoughts-2023-03-05" >}}) during [Exercism's 12in23 challenge](https://exercism.org/challenges/12in23), I'll be trying to complete the challenges in Rust (see my solutions [here](https://github.com/scubbo/advent-of-code-2023)). That's on top of trying to complete Exercism's "_December Diversions_", as well as 5 challenges in _another_ language for the year-long badge to make up for the fact that January was unassigned (and keeping up my reading of [Ward](https://www.parahumans.net/) to remain on-track to finish by the end of the year). It's going to be a busy month!
