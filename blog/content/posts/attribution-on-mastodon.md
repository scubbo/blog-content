Just a quick one to note that, following instructions on [this article](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2024/07/highlighting-journalism-on-mastodon/), I've added a meta tag to posts from this blog (`<meta name="fediverse:creator" content="scubbo@fosstodon.org" />`[^leading-at]) which should, hopefully, result in attribution when articles are shared on Mastodon (and apparently Discord too ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).

At the time of writing (2024-10-21), it's still not working - I've asked on Mastodon [looking](https://fosstodon.org/@scubbo/113307063383002019) for some [pointers](https://fosstodon.org/@scubbo/113306849504125879), as well as examining [the original post]() and [another post that I know they're working well for](https://nex-3.com/blog/a-non-technical-intro-to-webmentions/) and [using a debugger tool](https://www.ogtester.app/og?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.scubbo.org%2Fposts%2Fattribution-on-mastodon%2F), but no luck so far...ü§ûüèª

[^leading-at]: note that, interestingly, the tag in the actual HTML does not include a leading `@`
