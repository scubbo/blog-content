      # Cannot use `actions/setup-node` because that _itself_ requires `node` (it makes it available to user-code,
      # rather than to the system. Interesting discussion [here](https://gitea.com/gitea/act_runner/issues/538))

          echo "Hello World"
          # This is necessary because, if `grep ...` doesn't find anything, it will _return_ (not print) a value of 1
          # (non-zero return codes indicating errors in Unix - since there are many more ways for something to go wrong
          # than there are for it to go right!), and so the `files=` assignment will also return 1, and the whole operation
          # will be considered a failure.
          #
          # Since a non-zero value is truthy in Linux, we can use the OR operator (`||`) to only execute the second command
          # if the first one errors out. So, this line can be translated to English as:
          # "Set the variable `files` to a list of all the files that contain `TK` - unless there aren't any, in which case
          # set it to `FILES NOT FOUND"
          files=$(grep -rl 'TK' blog/content/posts || echo "FILES NOT FOUND")

          # We have to filter out (`grep -v`) the "marker" value of `FILES NOT FOUND`, otherwise the no-matches case would
          # be recorded as having 1 matching file, leading to an error-out below.
          # (I guess _technically_ there's an edge case in that, if I ever make a blog post titled "FILES NOT FOUND" _which also_
          # contains the string `TK`, it would slip through this check. But that feels pretty unlikely - not least because spaces
          # are very rare in my filesystem names - so I'm ok taking that risk)
          count=$(wc -l <(echo "$files" | grep -v "FILES NOT FOUND") | awk '{print $1}')
