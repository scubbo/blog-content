About me
--------

I'm an engineer at LegalZoom, and I spend a fair chunk of my free time tinkering with technology too.

I'm particularly interested in resiliency, continuous verification, and self-hosting.

You can see my code projects (including this blog's source code) at my [self-hosted Gitea instance](https://gitea.scubbo.org).
