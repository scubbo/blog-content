Just a quick one to note that, following instructions on [this article](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2024/07/highlighting-journalism-on-mastodon/), I've added a meta tag to posts from this blog (`<meta name="fediverse:creator" content="scubbo@fosstodon.org" />` - note that, at the time of writing, the linked article seems to incorrectly list a leading `@` which breaks attribution) which should, hopefully, result in attribution when articles are shared on Mastodon (and apparently Discord too ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).
