I've fallen out of the habit of blogging, recently, due to some personal/family stuff going down. In an effort to kickstart that process again, I'm taking on a smaller task that requires significantly less effortful thought - a rudimentary ["Uses" page](/uses), inspired by [the general practice](https://uses.tech/) of listing the stuff™️ used.

(Tagging this page was taxonomically amusing - technically it could have hit a ton more tags like `python`, `real-life`, `CI/CD`, `vault`, etc., because the `/uses` page _lists_ them - but I elected to go more focused)

Internal links:
[Link-text](\{\{< ref "/posts/name-of-post" >}})
(remove the slashes - this is so that the commented-out content will not prevent a built while editing)
