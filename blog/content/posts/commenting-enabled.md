If everything has worked as expected, comments should now be enabled on this blog via Disqus. Don't make me regret that. Ensure that your comments pass through the [Three Gates](https://medium.com/zen-pills/the-3-gates-of-speech-305eaaa999c9) - they should be true, necessary, and kind. If you want to espouse homophobia, transphobia, racism, fascism, anti-vax, or anything similar, you are not welcome here. Black Lives Matter, Trans Rights Are Human Rights.

I don't yet know if Disqus provides moderation - if it does, assume that every comment will be subject to approval. If it doesn't, I reserve the right to remove commenting as soon as it becomes problematic, and then you'll be the reason why we can't have nice things.

Also, in the interests of transparency - I enabled [Analytics Tracking](https://github.com/scubbo/blogContent/commit/68fde7bd75bc88dda81487b3458588a812ff7e61) in a previous commit. This is purely for my own interest in counting page-hits - I will not be selling this information (lol, as if anyone would be interested in poxy little site's traffic!), monetizing it, or passing it on anywhere. If you're uncomfortable with that tracking, I encourage you to either [block it](https://geekthis.net/post/block-google-analytics/), or to [read the blog content directly from source](https://github.com/scubbo/blogContent/tree/main/blog/content/posts).

I'll be replacing both of these features (comments and page-hit-counting) with self-hosted solutions as soon as I find time to follow the Cloudflared-related advice [here](https://eevans.co/blog/garage/).
